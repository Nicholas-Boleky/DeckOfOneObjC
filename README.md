# DeckOfOneObjC

## Approach

Very simple application I created while in my formal program that allows a user to tap a button and a new playing card will be drawn from a 'deck'. The application features some networking to handle the logic of pulling random cards. You can find more about the API used at http://deckofcardsapi.com/ 
I wanted to feature this to showcase that I have some limited experience working with obj-c and swift together.
